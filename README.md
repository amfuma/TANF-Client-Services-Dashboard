📊 Data Source  
The dataset is a fictional/synthetic summary of client service records from a TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) program.

📈 Project Overview

- **Total Service Hours by Region**: Compares service load across regions using bar charts.
- **Clients Served by Region & Service Type**: Stacked bars reveal service mix and regional imbalances (e.g., no Counseling in the West).
- **Service Type Outcomes**: Uses color-coded bars to highlight program effectiveness (e.g., 100% employment for Job Training).

🔍 Key Insights

- 💼 **Job Training** consistently led to employment — a standout success.
- ⚠️ **Counseling** and **Education** programs saw notable dropout rates.
- 📍 **Service gaps** identified: no Counseling in the West, and no Education in the South or West.

📌 Recommendations
Survey clients who dropped out to understand program barriers.

Investigate what makes Job Training so effective and adapt its strategies.

Consider expanding Counseling to regions currently underserved.
